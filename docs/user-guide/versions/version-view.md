1. Project and version information
2. Version's overall translation progress information.
3. A list of languages that are available for translation on the version.
4. Once a language is selected, a list of documents for the version will be shown, with progress information for each document and the selected language.

The different tabs for a version offer more information about it.

- **Documents** Similar to the languages tab, this view lets you select a single document to view detailed progress information for each language.
- **Groups** Shows if there are any groups that the version belongs to.
- **Settings** _(This is only available to Project Maintainers)_ allows the user to change version settings.
