# An overview on contributing translations

# Contributing Translations

Any translator who has joined a Language Team can participate in the document translation process. This chapter looks at the translation process, including:

- Opening a translation project
- Using the translation interface
- Keyboard shortcuts
- Using translation memory
- Dealing with conflicts

# Opening a Translation Project

## Projects

The Projects page of your translation site will list all projects available for translation. All translators who have joined a Language Team can open these projects and translate them in the language of each respective team.

To open a project:

1. Click on the Projects menu option on the top menu
1. Click the title of a project you wish to translate

## Project Information

A project information page will appear after selecting a translation project. This includes:

- The name of the project
- A description of the project
- The active iteration for the project
- Past iterations

## Iterations

An iteration is an instance or version of the project. Zanata allows for the translation of current and past versions of each project.

Each iteration contains a number of project translations dependent upon how many Language Teams you have joined. For example, a member of the English, Chinese and French Language Teams will see project translations for English, Chinese and French under each iteration.

Each iteration also has a progress bar for each language. Each progress bar shows the percentage of translation complete for each iteration. 

## Open an Iteration for Translation

A translator wishing to contribute to a project translation needs to click the "Translate" link for the desired iteration and language. This takes the translator to the web-based Translation Workspace (WebTrans), which is covered in the next section.
