 * After upgrade to GWT 2.5, some of the gwt related libraries start to break.
 * i.e. gwt-log see http://code.google.com/p/gwt-log/issues/detail?id=70
 * <p/>
 * Basically the libraries still reference com.google.gwt.core.client.GWTBridge
 * and it's been moved to com.google.gwt.core.shared in GWT 2.5. Before they
 * release new version this class needs to be in class path to make things work.
